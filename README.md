I understand how graphics are made with shaders, and i learnt the basics of HLSL and GC with the framework ShaderLab from UnityEngine.

we can see here, just from a **plane** , *transparency* , *depth*, *ripples*,water *refractions* and water *flow*.
I was just using maths to make normals map, height, etcs...

And with the inspector on unity engine, i can change many Properties as i want.
